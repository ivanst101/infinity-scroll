# Infinity Scroll

This repository contains an Infinity Scroll application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Unsplash API to fetch and display an endless stream of stunning images.




## Features

- Infinite Scrolling: Automatically loads more images as the user scrolls down, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- Unsplash API Integration: Fetches high-quality images from the Unsplash API, ensuring a diverse and visually appealing gallery.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to ensure a consistent user experience across all platforms.
- Efficient Loading: Implements lazy loading for images to improve performance and reduce initial load times.


## Getting started

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/infinity-scroll.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd infinity-scroll
3. Open index.html in your browser to view the application.
## How it works

- The application uses JavaScript to detect when the user is nearing the bottom of the page.
- When the bottom is approached, a request is made to the Unsplash API to fetch more images.
- Newly fetched images are appended to the existing gallery, creating an infinite scrolling effect.
